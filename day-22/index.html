        <p class="spy">Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan
            Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962)
            in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games,
            novels, and plays.

            Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage
            high-school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents,
            Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with
            the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
            Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black
            Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets
            his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include
            superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces
            and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He
            builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he
            uses both for fighting and web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker Initially used his powers for his
            personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his
            powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man</p>
